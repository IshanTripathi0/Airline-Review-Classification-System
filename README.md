## Introduction

The Airline Review Classification System is designed to analyze and classify airline reviews using machine learning. It aims to provide valuable insights to airlines by categorizing reviews into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. The project utilizes a variety of classification models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more.

## Project Phases

This project is organized into several phases, covering ideation, data collection, model development, performance testing, and result analysis. The goal is to create a system that efficiently processes and classifies airline reviews, offering actionable insights to improve services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (3.12)
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, imbalanced-learn, scikit-learn, xgboost
- Jupyter Notebook (for collaborative notebook)

### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smartinternz02/SI-GuidedProject-600258-1697458837.git
   cd SI-GuidedProject-600258-1697458837
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Project_Airline_Review_Classification.ipynb`) for collaborative coding and analysis.

2. Run the notebook cells to preprocess data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

3. Use the trained models for real-time review classification by running the Flask app (`app.py`).

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- `Materials/`: Contains the dataset used in the project.
- `Project Development Phase/`: Jupyter notebooks for  data cleaning, analysis & model devlopment.
- `Project Development Phase/FinalModel&Deployment/`: Pickle files for trained models.
- `static/` and `templates/`: Files for the Flask app.
